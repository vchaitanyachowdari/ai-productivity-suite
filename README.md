# AI Tools Hub Frontend

This is the frontend application for the AI Tools Hub, built with React.
It provides a central place to access various AI-powered tools.

## Available Tools

- **Note Taker**: Capture and organize your thoughts with AI-powered note-taking.
- **Email Enhancer**: Improve your email writing with AI suggestions for tone, grammar, and clarity.
- **Flashcards**: Create and study flashcards efficiently using AI to generate questions and answers.
- **Brainstorming**: Generate creative ideas and solutions with AI-assisted brainstorming sessions.
- **Meeting Summary**: Get concise summaries of your meetings, highlighting key decisions and action items.
- **CSV Visualizer**: Transform your CSV data into insightful visualizations and charts.
- **PDF Analyzer**: Extract key information, summarize, and analyze content from PDF documents.

## Setup and Installation

To set up and run the frontend application, follow these steps:

1.  **Navigate to the frontend directory**:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Start the development server**:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    This will open the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000` (or another available port).

## Project Structure

-   `src/pages`: Contains page-level components (e.g., Home, Tools).
-   `src/components`: Contains reusable UI components and individual tool implementations.
-   `src/api.js`: Provides mock implementations for AI API calls. In a real-world scenario, this would connect to a backend AI service.
-   `src/App.js`: Main application component, handles routing.
-   `src/index.js`: Entry point of the React application.
-   `src/App.css`: Global styles for the application.

## Further Development

-   **Integrate with a real AI Backend**: Replace the mock implementations in `src/api.js` with actual API calls to AI services.
-   **Enhance Tool Functionality**: Add more features and sophistication to each individual tool.
-   **Add Unit Tests**: Implement unit tests for components and utilities.
-   **Improve UI/UX**: Further refine the styling and user experience.
